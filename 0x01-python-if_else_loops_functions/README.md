README: 0x01 - Python - if/else, loops, functions

Project Description
This project focuses on learning Python basics related to conditional statements (if/else), loops, and functions. The project also delves into fundamental concepts such as indentation, variable assignments, and Python-specific functions and structures.

Learning Objectives
Understand the fundamental principles of Python programming.
Learn about indentation's importance in Python.
Implement conditional statements (if, if...else), comments, and variable assignments.
Master the use of while and for loops.
Differentiate Python's for from that in C.
Utilize break, continue, and else clauses in loops.
Understand the role and usage of the pass statement.
Work with Python's range.
Learn how to define and use functions.
Grasp the concept of returning a function that doesn't use a return statement.
Comprehend variable scopes and tracebacks.
Apply arithmetic operators and understand their usage.
Requirements
Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Interpreter: python3 (version 3.8.5) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Files must end with a newline character.
All files must start with #!/usr/bin/python3.
A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project directory.
Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
All files should be executable.
Code length will be evaluated using wc.
C Scripts (for specific tasks)

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc.
Files must end with a newline character.
Compiled using gcc options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
main.c files are provided for task tests.
The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file named lists.h.
Header files should have include guards.
Tasks
The project consists of multiple tasks involving Python scripts and a task in C scripting:

Determine if a randomly generated number is positive or negative.
Print the last digit of a randomly generated number.
Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
Print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
Print numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format.
Print all possible different combinations of two digits.
Check if a character is lowercase.
Print a string in uppercase.
Print the last digit of a number.
Add two integers and return the result.
Compute a number to the power of another number.
Print numbers from 1 to 100 with conditions applied (FizzBuzz).
Insert a number into a sorted singly linked list (C scripting).
Print the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
Remove a character from a string at a given index.
Recreate a Python function based on provided bytecode instructions
